## Instructions
Please code the problem, and email back the following:
1. Link to your Github project containing the code created to solve this problem
2. Attached screenshots of your code output.
3. Your answer to the follow-up question below. 



## Problem
Accounting has reveived a CSV file containing lines of accounting that shows transactions regarding the obligations and payments for military orders. Obligation transactions
are what is owed to the soldier and Payment transactions are what has been payed to the soldier already. Please write an application (preferably using the .NET Core framework)
that accomplishes the following:


  1. Identifies soldiers that are still owed miney as well as the amount owed.
  2. Identifies soldiers that have been overpaid for their order as well as the amount identified. 
  3. For the sake of simplicity, hard-coding the csv path / or contetents of the CSV path are allowed. 
  



## Follow-Up Question
 Accounting has approved this business proccess but feels that generating the CSV file and running the application can be fully automated. What questions would you ask Accounting? What changes and/or technologies would you use to accomplish this?
